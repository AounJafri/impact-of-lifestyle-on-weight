# Impact of Lifestyle Habits on Weight – Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a lifestyle and demographics survey dataset to explore how exercise habits, diet, sleep, and daily activity relate to body weight across different age groups.

The analysis focuses on descriptive insights derived from survey-based, range-encoded data using Python.

## Dataset
- Source: Self-collected survey dataset
- Records: 102 respondents
- Data Type: Categorical and range-based lifestyle indicators

## Objectives
- Analyze average weight across age groups
- Examine relationships between exercise frequency and workout duration
- Understand how meal frequency relates to weight
- Identify which age and weight groups are most physically active
- Analyze sleep patterns across age groups

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
1. Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering:
   - Converted range-based and ordinal survey responses into numeric representations using predefined mappings
4. Exploratory analysis and visualizations
5. Insight generation

## Key Insights
- Individuals aged 56+ show the highest average weight (~75 kg)
- No strong relationship observed between exercise frequency and workout duration
- Participants consuming 3–4 meals per day show higher average weight (~65 kg)
- The 36–55 age group records the highest average daily steps (~6,500)
- Average sleep duration peaks in the 36–55 age group (~7 hours)

## Limitations
- Small sample size
- Self-reported survey data
- Numeric values represent approximations of ranges

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis on real-world, imperfect survey data and highlights how lifestyle factors vary across demographic groups.
